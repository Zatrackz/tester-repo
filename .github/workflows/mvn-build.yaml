# The end result of this workflow will be an artifact being created.
# How can we store this artifact after the build before the runner is cleaned up?
# Artifact Upload: when an artifact is created and the job is done on the runner, Artifact Upload helps upload the artifact from the runner to Github repo.
# The goal of Artifact upload is to store the artifact in a repository so that the next job can make use of it.
